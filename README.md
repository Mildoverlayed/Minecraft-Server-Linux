# Minecraft Pi
 A server manager for a Raspberry Pi 5
This is the server side manager that you would put on a raspberry Pi that allows you to have multible modpacks and world on those modpacks BUT do to me not want to break your Pi only allowing 1 instance to run at 1 time in future might have a way to do multible

## What it can do
* open and host a minecraft server moded or not
* show temp of cpu


## Roadmap
* shut down server if to hot
