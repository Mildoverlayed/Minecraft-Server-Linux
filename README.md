Minecraft Server hoster for Ubuntu and Debian server and regualar Distro.
I know this has already been done and is most likely better but I wanted my take.
And this can do modded while automaticly changing and installing the needed java version since some better mods are made for older versions
 
For an example Server Go to https://github.com/Mildoverlayed/Example-Minecraft-Server.git or install during setup process

## INSTALL
if on windows open cmd and type wsl --install debian
then download and extract and run sudo bash setup.sh and follow instructions

if your not on windows its the exact same thing but without the wsl install + you probbly know what to do if you got this far





Java 8: Required for Minecraft versions 1.12 through 1.176.
Java 17: Required for Minecraft version 1.18 and up6.
